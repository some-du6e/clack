# Preferences audit (2026-11-08)

Every Slack Preferences page in Clack, compared against:

- **Slack's live desktop dialog**: the Hack Club workspace in a signed-in
  browser. It was read-only: tabs were clicked, nothing was toggled or typed.
  The DOM was dumped per tab (labels, input names and values, checked state).
- **Slack's web client source**: `gantry-v2-async-prefs-dialog` (build
  a84662d2d135) for the desktop-only branches (`isDesktop`, macOS and
  Windows/Linux rows), the Audio & video module in
  `gantry-v2-async-client-boot-shared`, and `modern.vendor` KlX6 for the
  theme shade tables.

Plugins / Themes / Plugin settings and Advanced > Updates / Troubleshooting
were out of scope and left as they were.

**Legend:** *applied* means Clack acts on the pref. *Server* means Slack's
servers act on it (mobile push, email, privacy), so writing it works for
real. *Greyed* means the row is drawn the way Slack draws it, disabled, with
"Not available in Clack yet".

| Page | Result | Prefs (users.prefs / all_notifications_prefs.global) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Availability | matched (no change). Still different: "VIPs" in the Working hours paragraph is plain text, not a link to the VIP tab | dnd_* / working hours (applied, popups) |
| Notifications | **fixed**, then made real (part A, 2026-11-09). Slack's order: Messaging defaults + About notifications · How to notify you (Desktop / Mobile) · What to notify you about (Everything / Mentions and direct messages, mobile follows unless overridden) · Also notify you about (Thread replies, VIPs, New huddles, Set up mobile overrides → mobile select) · What to show in Activity (activity_inbox only) · Channel keywords · Reminders · When you're not active on desktop · Sounds & appearance (macOS dock badge / bounce). Removed Clack's invented "On this computer" switch | **newly applied:** global_desktop_push_enabled; global_keywords (an editable field, 1 s debounce, max 100; keywords count as mentions and are highlighted, lxEU port); desktop_sound + mute_sounds (a message notification plays Slack's sound unless muted or DND; picking one previews it); huddle_invite_sound_v2 + mute_huddle_sounds (the invite ring); mac_ssb_bullet / mac_ssb_bounce (Dock badge • and bounce). Applied: global_desktop, no_text_in_notifications. Server: global_mobile, push_idle_wait, threads_everything, priority_dnd_override, huddles_allow_smart_notif, inactive_user_summary_notification, activity_dms_opt_out, global_channels_in_activity, global_reminders_in_activity, reminder_notification_time (half-hour TimePicker, "H:mm"; Slack's servers send day-only reminders at it). Greyed: none |
| VIP | **fixed** labels, subtexts and order; then made real (part A) | priority_dnd_override (server), vip_users + users.priority.add/remove (applied: the member search adds, Remove removes), Recommended (users.priority.getRecommendations, up to six with Slack's reason lines), priority_sidebar_section (the row shows under vip_section_pref; core makes Slack's client-local "VIP unreads" section first, holding DMs/group DMs with a VIP that have unread mentions). Greyed: none |
| Navigation | **fixed**. Replaced Clack's invented "Show the sidebar" / "Reset sidebar width" with Slack's tab checkboxes, Move up / Move down, Icons & text / Icons only, and App agents & assistants. Still different: no drag reordering; Move up/down act on the tab last toggled | **newly written** (the rail already applied them): tab_rail_customization + tab_rail_customization_reasons (setTabRailCustomizationByTabName), tab_rail_customization_order, ia4_compact_mode. Greyed: show_ai_apps, hide_agents_in_dm_list |
| Home | **fixed**. Added Channel organization and Show activity; views in Slack's order (Unreads, Huddles, Threads, Saved, Drafts & sent, Directories) with Slack's defaults (on); custom filter/sort hints; External Connections row; "Hide muted channels from your sidebar" (improve_mute_pref: the box is the pref's negation) with its helper text | **newly applied:** enable_threads_view, enable_huddles_home_view, enable_sent_view, enable_saved_view, enable_unified_directory_view hide the sidebar links; home_unread_dot (Slack's real key; its input is named enable_home_unread_dot): off, the Home tab has no dot or badge; show_sidebar_avatars: off, DM rows show the presence badge; should_show_connect_section: externally shared conversations go to the slack_connect section. Server: disable_auto_channel_sort (the server files joined channels; the client only reads auto_sort upserts). Applied: sidebar_behavior, channel_sort, separate_private_channels, undo_channel_intermix, boost_mentions, show_muted_items_outside_sidebar_menus. Greyed: enable_unread_view (no Unreads view yet), disable_channel_join_banner (no channel join banner yet) |
| Appearance | **fixed**, then part A. Font row; Color Mode (Light / Dark / System, desktop) plus the focus-mode dark row; **Slack themes \| Custom theme** tabs. Custom theme has Slack's four hex fields (typed hex, or the pencil's "Pick a color" popover: HSV square, hue slider, hex field), Share, **Import** (Slack's Import theme modal: 4 hexes or a legacy 8/10-colour string, createPayloadFromHexStrings) and **Surprise me** (randomizeTheme). A custom primary sets the brightness (getBrightnessFromCustomHex). The "Celebrate the music of Miles Davis" presets show first under miles_davis_themes | ia_theme (applied), window_background_gradients (applied), colour mode (device). Greyed: font (device-local; Clack draws Lato only), focus_mode_force_dark_mode_enabled (Clack has no focus mode) |
| Messages & media | **fixed**, then part A. Default Skin Tone as Slack's six ✋ radios (:wave: on hover), "your profile" link, JUMBOMOJI subtext, legends as Slack's | **newly applied:** preferred_skin_tone, emoji_mode as_text (emoji draw as :name:, no JUMBOMOJI; turning it on writes convert_emoticons 0), convert_emoticons (the composer converts the emoticon before Space/Enter, Slack's dq table), obey_inline_img_limit (linked images over 20MB stay collapsed), one-click reactions (user_customized_quick_reactions_display_feature 1/0, frequent / custom slots; the hover toolbar shows them), Bring emails into Slack (users.emailtoken.get / create / delete, Copy). Applied: display_real_names_override, show_typing, time24, hide_hex_swatch, jumbomoji, expand_internal_inline_imgs, expand_inline_imgs, expand_non_media_attachments. Greyed: messages_theme (Clean / Compact; no compact message layout yet, so no example previews) |
| Language & region | **fixed**, then part A. Keyboard layout row, Slack's spellcheck label. The time zone select lists Slack's 124 labelled zones ("(UTC-08:00) Pacific Time (US and Canada)") | **newly applied:** set_tz_automatically (on: the detected zone is written at once and after every sign-in, maybeUpdateTimezone with Slack's zone tables). Server: tz. Greyed: locale (no translated UI), webapp_spellcheck (no spellchecker) |
| Accessibility | **fixed**. Alt text reminders legend, tab previews, Slack's animations subtext, the three up-arrow options with descriptions and the Ctrl+↑ note, Lists keyboard interactions, Screen reader (Message verbosity, announcements), links to Notifications and Font. Removed invented "Limit message line length" | applied: underline_links, a11y_animations. Greyed: a11y_show_alt_text_reminders, a11y_peeks_enabled_on_mouse_enter, composer_up_arrow_shortcut, lists_keyboard_interaction, a11y_dm_read_out, a11y_huddles_reactions_* |
| Mark as read | **fixed**. Removed the invented hint under Prompt to confirm; added Keyboard shortcuts | applied: mark_msgs_read_immediately + start_scroll_at_oldest (one users.prefs.set), confirm_clear_all_unreads |
| Audio & video | **fixed**. Camera, Microphone, gain control, noise suppression, auto-dock, 150-member warning, blur, Huddle motion, music delay. Removed "Set my status In a huddle" (Slack shows it under Availability) and "Turn off my video" (gated off in the live dialog) | applied: huddles_mute_by_default. Greyed: huddles_cc_by_default, huddles_show_shouty_rooster, video_background_filter, huddles_show_join_preview, huddles_global_mute, huddles_disconnect_on_lock, huddles_play_music_when_last, clips_pip_auto_dock, agc/ns |
| Salesforce | **fixed**. Slack's exact copy; removed Clack's invented sentence | none |
| Connected accounts | **fixed**. Slack's copy, Learn more, "Apps connected through workflows". Still different: the list isn't fetched (stand-in) | none |
| Privacy & visibility | **fixed**. Learn more links, "Preferences only apply to this workspace" note + Find my workspaces (greyed), the workspace name in Contact sharing, People you've hidden. Removed the invented Privacy Mode section | server: who_can_see_account_by_searching_email, who_can_share_contact_card |
| Advanced | **fixed**. Slack's Input options order and copy, Enter-key radios, Search options, Download location, Confirmations and warnings, Other options, Launch on login / notification-area rows (Linux, Windows). Removed "Copy message text as Markdown" (gated off in the live dialog). Clack's own Live updates / Updates / Troubleshooting section kept | **newly applied:** msg_input_send_btn (Enter adds a line, Mod+Enter sends). Applied: enter_is_special_in_tbt, plain_text_mode. Server: overloaded_message_enabled, in_prod_surveys_enabled. Greyed: disable_smart_symbols, disable_link_truncation, search_exclude_channels, stick_user_sort, should_show_unsend_message_confirmation, confirm_user_marked_away, suppress_link_warning, hide_sc_files_sharing_speed_bump, hide_external_members_canvas_sharing_speed_bump |

## Still greyed after part A, and the plan for each

- **enable_unread_view** (Home): Slack's Unreads view (gantry chunks
  page-unreads-view and the catch-up hooks): a sidebar link and a page
  listing unread conversations, newest first, with Mark as read per
  conversation. Clack has the counts and message lists; it needs the view
  in internal/ui/views (one more synthetic-view route like Threads) and the
  sidebar link the pref shows.
- **disable_channel_join_banner** (Home): the
  megaphone-message-pane-input-channel-join-banner chunk, shown over the
  composer after joining a channel (section and notification suggestions).
  Port the banner into the composer chrome, then enable the row.
- **messages_theme** (Messages & media): Compact ("dense") is a second row
  layout for every message (name and time on one line, no avatar column)
  plus Slack's CompactMessageExample / clean example in the dialog. It
  touches internal/ui/messages row layout, so it wants its own branch.
- **font** (Appearance): device-local (Slack keeps it in localStorage). The
  list is Lato, Arial, Comic Sans, Georgia, Noto Sans, OpenDyslexic, Roboto
  Mono, Verdana, Atkinson Hyperlegible Next and the system font. It needs
  per-OS font discovery and Slack's CDN web fonts (woff2, so a woff2
  decoder) loaded under theme.Typeface, then a shaper rebuild.
- **focus_mode_force_dark_mode_enabled** (Appearance): only means something
  once Clack has Slack's focus mode.
- **locale** (Language & region): the whole UI's strings through a catalog
  for Slack's 12 locales (Slack's i18n bundles are per-locale chunks), plus
  the localized time zone and sound lists Slack already ships (sbu9 has 11).
- **webapp_spellcheck**: a spellchecker in the composer (NSSpellChecker on
  macOS, ISpellChecker on Windows, hunspell dictionaries on Linux) with the
  red underline and suggestions menu.

## Tests

- `TestPrefsPagesMatchSlack` (internal/ui/prefs_pages_test.go) draws every
  page against fakeslack. It checks each page's controls, headings and order
  against Slack's, and which rows are enabled or greyed. It also checks that
  none of the removed invented rows came back, and checks the Custom theme
  fields' default hexes.
- `TestPrefsAuditAppliedRoundTrip` and `TestPrefsMobileOverrides` cover the
  newly applied prefs. For each one, the row writes Slack's key and value to
  fakeslack, core reads it back, and Clack acts on it (no notification, rail,
  sidebar links, ia_theme).
- `TestSendOnModEnter` (composer) and `TestRoleHexAubergine` (theme).
- Part A: `TestPrefsAuditAppliedRoundTrip{Sounds,Keywords,Dock,Home,Messages,Time,VIP,ThemeButtons}`,
  `TestPrefsSkinToneHandsAndMilesDavis`, `TestPrefsEmailForwarding` and
  `TestColorPopover` (internal/ui/prefs_a_test.go); `TestConnectSectionPref`,
  `TestKeywordMention`, `TestPrioritySection` (core);
  `TestLocateHighlightWords`, `TestHighlightDocSplitsSpans` (richtext);
  `TestLastEmoticon`, `TestEmoticonOnSpace` (composer);
  `TestQuickReactionsFollowPrefs` (messages); `TestImportThemeString`,
  `TestSurpriseTheme` (theme).
- `TestPrefsAuditShots` with the `prefs-audit-shots` workflow: every page,
  one shot per screenful, light and dark, uploaded as the `prefs-audit-shots`
  artifact.
